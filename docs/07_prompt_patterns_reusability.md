# Reusability Best Practices for AI Agents

## Overview
This document outlines best practices for creating reusable AI agent components, prompt patterns, and safety utilities that can be shared across teams and projects, with specific focus on healthcare environments like Healthee.

## What is Reusability in AI Agents?

### **Definition**
Reusability means creating AI agent components, prompt patterns, and safety utilities that can be used across different projects, teams, and use cases without starting from scratch each time.

### **Why Reusability Matters**
- **Consistency** - Same patterns across all projects
- **Speed** - Don't reinvent the wheel for each new project
- **Quality** - Proven patterns work better than ad-hoc solutions
- **Knowledge Sharing** - Teams learn from each other's successes
- **Compliance** - Standardized HIPAA patterns ensure consistency
- **Cost Efficiency** - Reduce development time and maintenance overhead

---

## Reusability Patterns

### **1. Reusable Prompt Components**

#### **Bad Example (Not Reusable)**
```
You are a healthcare assistant. Analyze this patient data: {data}
```

#### **Good Example (Reusable)**
```python
# Base healthcare assistant prompt
HEALTHCARE_ASSISTANT_ROLE = "You are a healthcare assistant with expertise in {domain}"

# Reusable analysis pattern
ANALYSIS_PATTERN = """
Let me analyze this {data_type} step by step:
1. Identify key information
2. Assess the situation  
3. Provide recommendations
"""

# Combine them
def create_prompt(domain, data_type, data):
    return f"{HEALTHCARE_ASSISTANT_ROLE.format(domain=domain)}\n{ANALYSIS_PATTERN.format(data_type=data_type)}\nData: {data}"
```

### **2. Reusable Agent Functions**

#### **Safety Components**
```python
def validate_phi_data(data):
    """Remove PHI from data before processing"""
    return mask_phi(data)

def log_agent_action(action, user_id, timestamp):
    """Log agent actions for audit"""
    audit_log.log(action, user_id, timestamp)

def get_user_permissions(user_id):
    """Get user permissions for access control"""
    return permission_service.get_permissions(user_id)
```

#### **Pattern Components**
```python
def apply_chain_of_thought_prompt(task, context):
    """Apply chain-of-thought reasoning pattern"""
    return f"""
Let me think through this step by step:

Task: {task}
Context: {context}

Step 1: First, I need to understand what's being asked
Step 2: Then, I'll analyze the available information
Step 3: Finally, I'll provide my reasoning and conclusion
"""

def apply_structured_output_prompt(task, output_format):
    """Apply structured output pattern"""
    return f"""
Complete this task: {task}

Respond in this exact format:
{output_format}
"""
```

### **3. Reusable Configuration**

#### **Agent Configuration Templates**
```yaml
# agent_config.yaml
patient_triage:
  role: "healthcare_assistant"
  domain: "patient_care"
  safety_level: "high"
  max_response_time: 3.0
  required_permissions: ["read_patient_data"]
  
insurance_analysis:
  role: "data_analyst"
  domain: "insurance"
  safety_level: "medium"
  max_response_time: 5.0
  required_permissions: ["read_insurance_data"]
```

#### **Model Configuration**
```yaml
# model_config.yaml
gpt4:
  model_name: "gpt-4"
  max_tokens: 4000
  temperature: 0.1
  safety_settings: "high"
  
claude3:
  model_name: "claude-3-sonnet"
  max_tokens: 4000
  temperature: 0.1
  safety_settings: "high"
```

## Healthcare-Specific Reusability

### **HIPAA-Compliant Components**

#### **PHI Masking Utilities**
```python
class PHIMasking:
    @staticmethod
    def mask_patient_data(data):
        """Mask PHI in patient data"""
        # Remove names, SSNs, DOBs, addresses
        masked = remove_names(data)
        masked = remove_ssn(masked)
        masked = remove_dob(masked)
        masked = remove_address(masked)
        return masked
    
    @staticmethod
    def validate_no_phi(data):
        """Validate that no PHI is present"""
        phi_patterns = [r'\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b', r'\b[A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+\b']
        for pattern in phi_patterns:
            if re.search(pattern, data):
                raise PHIExposureError("PHI detected in data")
        return True
```

#### **Audit Logging Components**
```python
class AuditLogger:
    @staticmethod
    def log_agent_action(agent_id, action, user_id, timestamp, success):
        """Log agent actions without PHI"""
        log_entry = {
            "agent_id": agent_id,
            "action": action,
            "user_id": user_id,
            "timestamp": timestamp,
            "success": success,
            "ip_address": get_client_ip()
        }
        # Never log actual patient data
        audit_system.log(log_entry)
    
    @staticmethod
    def generate_compliance_report(start_date, end_date):
        """Generate compliance report for auditors"""
        return {
            "total_actions": get_total_actions(start_date, end_date),
            "successful_actions": get_successful_actions(start_date, end_date),
            "unique_users": get_unique_users(start_date, end_date),
            "time_range": f"{start_date} to {end_date}"
        }
```

### **Healthcare-Specific Patterns**

#### **Patient Data Analysis Pattern**
```python
def create_patient_analysis_prompt(analysis_type, safety_level):
    """Create patient analysis prompt with appropriate safety controls"""
    base_prompt = """
You are a healthcare assistant analyzing patient data.

SAFETY REQUIREMENTS:
- Never expose PHI in your response
- Focus on clinical patterns, not personal information
- Provide evidence-based recommendations only
"""
    
    if safety_level == "high":
        base_prompt += "\n- Require healthcare professional review for all recommendations"
    
    return base_prompt + f"\nAnalysis type: {analysis_type}"
```

#### **Insurance Claim Processing Pattern**
```python
def create_insurance_analysis_prompt(claim_type, coverage_level):
    """Create insurance analysis prompt"""
    return f"""
You are an insurance data analyst processing {claim_type} claims.

Coverage level: {coverage_level}

Analyze this claim and provide:
1. Coverage determination
2. Cost breakdown
3. Recommendations for approval/denial
4. Required documentation

Remember: Focus on coverage rules, not patient identity.
"""
```

## Cross-Team Reusability

### **Marketing Team Components**
```python
def create_content_generation_prompt(content_type, brand_voice):
    """Create content generation prompt for marketing"""
    return f"""
You are a content creator for a healthcare company.

Content type: {content_type}
Brand voice: {brand_voice}

Create engaging, accurate content that:
- Educates patients about healthcare
- Maintains professional tone
- Includes relevant medical disclaimers
- Avoids making medical claims
"""
```

### **Operations Team Components**
```python
def create_process_automation_prompt(process_type, compliance_level):
    """Create process automation prompt"""
    return f"""
You are an operations assistant automating {process_type} processes.

Compliance level: {compliance_level}

Help streamline workflows while ensuring:
- HIPAA compliance for all data handling
- Audit trail for all actions
- Error handling and validation
- User-friendly interfaces
"""
```

### **Customer Support Components**
```python
def create_support_triage_prompt(issue_type, escalation_level):
    """Create customer support triage prompt"""
    return f"""
You are a customer support assistant triaging {issue_type} issues.

Escalation level: {escalation_level}

Analyze the issue and:
1. Categorize the problem type
2. Determine urgency level
3. Suggest resolution steps
4. Identify if escalation is needed

Remember: Never access patient data directly.

    for test_case in test_cases:
        try:
            result = component(test_case.input)
            results.append({
                "success": True,
                "result": result,
                "test_case": test_case.name
            })
        except Exception as e:
            results.append({
                "success": False,
                "error": str(e),
                "test_case": test_case.name
            })
    return results
```

### **Version Control Best Practices**
- **Semantic versioning** (v1.0.0, v1.1.0, v2.0.0)
- **Breaking change documentation**
- **Migration guides** for major updates
- **Backward compatibility** when possible

### **Documentation Requirements**
- **Usage examples** for each component
- **Performance characteristics**
- **Safety and compliance notes**
- **Integration instructions**

---

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### **Pitfall 1: Over-Abstraction**
**Problem:** Making components too generic, losing specificity
**Solution:** Create focused components for specific use cases, then compose them

### **Pitfall 2: Poor Documentation**
**Problem:** Components exist but no one knows how to use them
**Solution:** Comprehensive documentation with examples and use cases

### **Pitfall 3: Version Conflicts**
**Problem:** Different teams using different versions of the same component
**Solution:** Clear versioning strategy and migration paths

### **Pitfall 4: Security Gaps**
**Problem:** Reusable components don't maintain security standards
**Solution:** Built-in security validation and regular security reviews

### **Pitfall 5: Performance Issues**
**Problem:** Reusable components become performance bottlenecks
**Solution:** Performance testing and optimization for shared components
