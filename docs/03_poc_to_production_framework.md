# Proof of Concept to Production Framework

## Overview
This framework provides a structured approach for moving internal tools from initial concept to production-ready systems, with specific considerations for HIPAA-compliant healthcare environments like Healthee.

## Phase 2: Low-Code Platform Validation

### **Objective**
Rapidly build and deploy a working solution using low-code platforms to validate user adoption and refine requirements.

- [ ] **Integration capabilities** - Can connect to existing Healthee systems
- [ ] **Scalability** - Can handle expected user load
- [ ] **Security features** - Role-based access, audit logging
- [ ] **Cost efficiency** - Reasonable pricing for pilot phase

### **Recommended Platforms for Healthee**
- **Microsoft Power Platform** - Enterprise-grade, HIPAA compliant
- **Retool** - Internal tool building, strong security
- **Zapier** - Simple automations, good for workflows
- **Airtable** - Data workflows, user-friendly

### **Low-Code Implementation Requirements**
- [ ] **Real data integration** - Connect to actual systems (with PHI protection)
- [ ] **User authentication** - Integrate with company SSO
- [ ] **Audit logging** - Track all user actions
- [ ] **Error handling** - Graceful failure modes
- [ ] **Performance monitoring** - Basic metrics collection

### **Measurement & Checkpoints**
- **Daily Active Users**: Track consistent usage patterns
- **Error Rate**: <5% of operations fail
- **Response Time**: <3 seconds for typical operations
- **User Retention**: >60% weekly retention rate
- **Support Tickets**: <10% of users need help

### **Exit Criteria to Next Phase**
- [ ] Sustained user adoption (>4 weeks)
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Security/compliance validated
- [ ] Clear production requirements defined
