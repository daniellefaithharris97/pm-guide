## Prompt Patterns - Best Practices

### **Understanding Prompt Patterns**
Prompt patterns are reusable templates and structures for different types of AI interactions. They help ensure consistent, reliable responses across different use cases.

### **Common Prompt Patterns**

#### **1. Chain-of-Thought Pattern**
**When to use:** Complex reasoning, analysis, problem-solving
**Structure:** "Let me think through this step by step..."
**Example:**
```
You are a healthcare assistant. Let me analyze this patient information step by step:

1. First, I'll identify the key symptoms
2. Then, I'll assess the severity
3. Finally, I'll provide my recommendation

Patient data: {patient_data}
```

#### **2. Role-Based Pattern**
**When to use:** When you need specific expertise or perspective
**Structure:** "You are a [role] with expertise in [domain]..."
**Example:**
```
You are a healthcare data analyst with expertise in insurance claims. 
Analyze this claim and provide recommendations for coverage determination.

Claim data: {claim_data}
```

#### **3. Structured Output Pattern**
**When to use:** When you need consistent, parseable responses
**Structure:** "Respond in this exact format..."
**Example:**
```
Analyze this patient case and respond in this format:

DIAGNOSIS: [your diagnosis]
CONFIDENCE: [0.0-1.0]
RECOMMENDATIONS: [list of recommendations]
URGENCY: [Low/Medium/High]

Patient data: {patient_data}
```

#### **4. Few-Shot Learning Pattern**
**When to use:** When you need the AI to follow specific examples
**Structure:** Show examples before asking for similar work
**Example:**
```
Here are examples of how to analyze patient symptoms:

Example 1:
Symptoms: Fever, cough, shortness of breath
Analysis: Respiratory symptoms with fever suggest possible infection
Recommendation: Urgent care evaluation

Example 2:
Symptoms: Headache, fatigue, muscle aches
Analysis: General symptoms, likely viral
Recommendation: Rest and monitor

Now analyze this case:
Symptoms: {new_symptoms}
```

#### **5. Context Retrieval Pattern**
**When to use:** When you need to pull relevant information first
**Structure:** "First, retrieve relevant information, then analyze..."
**Example:**
```
First, retrieve the patient's medical history and current symptoms.
Then, analyze the information to provide a recommendation.

Patient ID: {patient_id}
Current symptoms: {symptoms}
```

### **Pattern Selection Framework**

#### **Step 1: Identify Task Type**
- **Classification** → Few-shot learning
- **Analysis** → Chain-of-thought
- **Generation** → Role-based
- **Extraction** → Structured output
- **Research** → Context retrieval

#### **Step 2: Consider Model Capabilities**
- **GPT-4:** Good at all patterns, especially reasoning
- **Claude-3:** Excellent at structured output and analysis
- **Llama-2:** Better with examples and simple tasks

#### **Step 3: Test and Iterate**
- Start with the most appropriate pattern
- Test with real examples
- Iterate based on results

## Prompt Tracking - Best Practices

### **What to Track**

#### **Essential Metrics**
- **Success Rate:** Percentage of successful responses
- **Response Time:** How long the AI takes to respond
- **Error Rate:** Percentage of failed responses
- **User Satisfaction:** Ratings or feedback from users

#### **Advanced Metrics**
- **Usage Frequency:** How often each prompt is used
- **Performance Trends:** How metrics change over time
- **Cost Analysis:** Cost per successful response
- **User Behavior:** Follow-up questions, retries, abandonment

### **Tracking Methods**

#### **1. Simple File-Based Tracking**
**Best for:** Getting started, small teams
**Implementation:** JSON file with prompt data
**Example:**
```json
{
  "patient_triage": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "template": "You are a healthcare assistant...",
    "performance": {
      "success_rate": 0.94,
      "avg_response_time": 2.3,
      "total_uses": 150
    }
  }
}
```

#### **2. Database Tracking**
**Best for:** Production systems, multiple users
**Implementation:** Database table with performance data
**Benefits:** Structured data, easy analysis, scalable

#### **3. Cloud Monitoring**
**Best for:** Enterprise systems, real-time monitoring
**Implementation:** AWS CloudWatch, Google Cloud Monitoring
**Benefits:** Real-time dashboards, automated alerts, historical data

### **Version Control Best Practices**

#### **Simple Versioning**
- **v1.0:** Original prompt
- **v1.1:** Small improvement
- **v2.0:** Major change
- **Always keep old versions** for rollback

#### **Change Documentation**
- **What changed:** Specific modifications made
- **Why changed:** Reason for the change
- **Performance impact:** Expected improvement
- **Test results:** Validation before deployment

#### **Deployment Strategy**
1. **Test in development** first
2. **A/B test with small group** (10% of users)
3. **Monitor performance** closely
4. **Gradual rollout** if successful
5. **Rollback plan** if issues arise

## Performance Monitoring

### **Daily Monitoring (Quick Check)**
**What to track:**
- Success rate (should be >90%)
- Response time (should be <3 seconds)
- Error count (should be minimal)
- Usage volume (trending up or down?)

**Where to see it:**
- Simple dashboard
- Log files
- Email alerts for problems

### **Weekly Analysis (Pattern Recognition)**
**What to track:**
- Performance trends over time
- Which prompts work best
- Error patterns and causes
- User adoption rates

**Where to see it:**
- Database reports
- Spreadsheet analysis
- Analytics dashboard

### **Monthly Review (Strategic Decisions)**
**What to track:**
- Overall system performance
- Cost per successful response
- User satisfaction trends
- Business impact metrics

**Where to see it:**
- Comprehensive analytics dashboard
- Executive reports
- Performance reviews

## A/B Testing Best Practices

### **Simple A/B Testing Process**
1. **Create two versions** of the same prompt
2. **Split users randomly** (50/50 or 90/10)
3. **Run for sufficient time** (at least 1 week)
4. **Compare results** using statistical significance
5. **Choose the better version**

### **What to Test**
- **Different prompt structures** (role-based vs. step-by-step)
- **Different examples** (few-shot variations)
- **Different output formats** (structured vs. free-form)
- **Different context lengths** (more vs. less information)

### **Success Criteria**
- **Statistical significance** (p < 0.05)
- **Meaningful difference** (>5% improvement)
- **Consistent results** across different user groups
- **No negative side effects** on other metrics
