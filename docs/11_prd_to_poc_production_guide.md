# PRD to POC & Production: Decision Framework

## Overview
This guide provides specific instructions for breaking down a Product Requirements Document (PRD) into POC (Proof of Concept) and Production phases. It includes constraint-based decision-making and platform selection criteria that adapt to your project's specific requirements.

## Part 1: Analyzing Your PRD

### **Step 1: Identify Project Constraints**

Before splitting your PRD, catalog all constraints that will determine your approach:

#### **Compliance Constraints**
- [ ] **HIPAA Required**: Handles Protected Health Information (PHI)
- [ ] **GDPR/CCPA Required**: Handles EU/CA personal data
- [ ] **SOC 2 Required**: Enterprise security requirements
- [ ] **No Compliance Required**: Internal tools with non-sensitive data

#### **Data Sensitivity**
- [ ] **High**: PHI, financial data, SSNs, medical records
- [ ] **Medium**: Business contact info, employee data, customer names
- [ ] **Low**: Public data, synthetic data, non-personal info

#### **Scale Requirements**
- [ ] **High Volume**: >1000 users or >10k daily operations
- [ ] **Medium Volume**: 100-1000 users or 1k-10k daily operations
- [ ] **Low Volume**: <100 users or <1k daily operations

#### **Integration Complexity**
- [ ] **High**: Multiple systems, real-time sync, complex workflows
- [ ] **Medium**: 3-5 integrations, some automation
- [ ] **Low**: 1-2 integrations, simple data flow

#### **Time to Value**
- [ ] **Urgent**: Need working solution in <4 weeks
- [ ] **Standard**: 4-12 weeks acceptable
- [ ] **Long-term**: >12 weeks, focus on robustness

## Part 2: Platform Selection Matrix

### **Low-Code/No-Code Platform Comparison (2024)**

| Platform | HIPAA Compliant | SOC 2 | Best For | Cost | Complexity | Limitations |
|----------|----------------|-------|----------|------|------------|-------------|
| **Retool** | ✅ Yes (with BAA) | ✅ Yes | Internal tools, dashboards, admin panels | $$$$ | Medium | Limited public-facing apps |
| **Microsoft Power Platform** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Enterprise workflows, Office integration | $$$ | Medium | Microsoft ecosystem lock-in |
| **OutSystems** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Complex enterprise apps | $$$$$ | High | Expensive, steep learning curve |
| **Bubble** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Customer-facing web apps | $$ | Low-Medium | Not HIPAA compliant |
| **Zapier** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Simple automations, integrations | $$ | Low | No PHI, limited logic |
| **Make.com** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Complex automations, visual workflows | $$ | Low-Medium | No PHI, workflow focus |
| **n8n** | ⚠️ Self-hosted only | ⚠️ Self-hosted | Automation, self-hosted control | $ | Medium | Requires infrastructure |
| **Airtable** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Data management, collaboration | $$ | Low | No PHI, limited automation |
| **Base44** | ❌ No | ❌ No | Rapid prototyping, simple apps | $$ | Low | NOT HIPAA compliant |
| **Custom (Cursor/Python)** | ✅ Yes (if built correctly) | ✅ Yes (if built correctly) | Full control, complex requirements | $$$$$ | High | Requires development expertise |

### **Decision Tree: Choosing Your Platform**

```
START: Does your project handle PHI or require HIPAA compliance?
│
├─ YES → HIPAA Required
│   ├─ Need fast POC (<4 weeks)?
│   │   └─ Use: Retool or Microsoft Power Platform (with BAA)
│   │       - POC: Build with synthetic data only
│   │       - Production: Enable PHI handling with full compliance
│   │
│   └─ Need full control or complex logic?
│       └─ Use: Custom Build (Cursor + Python)
│           - POC: Synthetic data, core workflow only
│           - Production: Full HIPAA implementation
│
└─ NO → HIPAA Not Required
    ├─ Simple automation needed?
    │   └─ Use: Zapier or Make.com
    │       - POC: Connect 2-3 core integrations
    │       - Production: Add error handling, monitoring
    │
    ├─ Internal tool/dashboard?
    │   └─ Use: Retool, Bubble, or Airtable
    │       - POC: Core features with real data
    │       - Production: Add auth, permissions, polish
    │
    └─ Complex customer-facing app?
        └─ Use: Bubble (simpler) or Custom Build (complex)
            - POC: MVP feature set
            - Production: Full feature set, optimization
```

## Part 3: Breaking Down Your PRD

### **Step 1: Feature Categorization**

Go through your PRD and categorize every feature:

#### **POC Features (Must-Have for Validation)**
Features that:
- Demonstrate core value proposition
- Can be tested with synthetic/non-sensitive data
- Prove technical feasibility
- Show user workflow basics
- Take <4 weeks to implement

**Example:**
```
✅ POC: Basic patient search (synthetic data)
✅ POC: Coverage calculation (test scenarios)
✅ POC: Simple recommendation display
❌ NOT POC: Advanced filtering
❌ NOT POC: Full audit logging
❌ NOT POC: Multi-user permissions
```

#### **Production Features (Required for Scale)**
Features that:
- Handle real user data securely
- Support multiple users/permissions
- Include monitoring and alerting
- Provide error handling and recovery
- Include compliance requirements

**Example:**
```
✅ Production: Real PHI handling with masking
✅ Production: Role-based access control
✅ Production: Complete audit trail
✅ Production: Performance monitoring
✅ Production: Automated backups
```

#### **Future Features (Post-Launch)**
Features that:
- Are nice-to-have enhancements
- Can be added iteratively
- Don't block initial launch
- Require user feedback first

## Part 4: Constraint-Based Decision Examples

### **Example 1: Healthcare Feature (HIPAA Required)**

**Original PRD**: Patient triage tool that analyzes symptoms and recommends care urgency

**Constraints Analysis**:
- ✅ HIPAA Required: YES (handles patient symptoms)
- ✅ Data Sensitivity: HIGH (medical information)
- ✅ Scale Requirements: MEDIUM (100 staff members)
- ✅ Time to Value: STANDARD (8 weeks acceptable)

**Platform Decision**: Custom Build (Cursor + Python)
- **Why**: HIPAA compliance requires full control over data handling
- **Alternative**: Retool with BAA (if simpler logic)

**POC Scope**:
```markdown
## POC (Weeks 1-4)
- Use: Cursor + Python with Claude API
- Data: Synthetic patient scenarios only
- Features:
  ✅ Symptom input form
  ✅ Basic triage logic (3 urgency levels)
  ✅ Simple recommendation display
  ❌ NO real patient data
  ❌ NO PHI handling
  ❌ NO audit logging

## Production (Weeks 5-12)
- Infrastructure: Docker + Kubernetes
- Features Added:
  ✅ PHI masking and encryption
  ✅ Role-based access control
  ✅ Complete audit trail
  ✅ HIPAA compliance validation
  ✅ Performance monitoring
```

### **Example 2: Sales Automation (No HIPAA)**

**Constraints Analysis**:
- ❌ HIPAA Required: NO (business contact data only)
- ✅ Data Sensitivity: MEDIUM (business emails, names)
- ✅ Scale Requirements: LOW (20 sales reps)
- ✅ Time to Value: URGENT (<4 weeks)

**Platform Decision**: Zapier or Make.com
- **Why**: Fast setup, good for simple automation, no PHI concerns
- **Cost**: ~$50-100/month

## Part 6: Common Mistakes to Avoid

### **❌ Mistake 1: Building POC with Production Mindset**
**Problem**: Over-engineering the POC, spending 8 weeks on something that should take 2

**Solution**: Ruthlessly cut scope. POC = "Can we prove this works?" not "Can we launch this?"

### **❌ Mistake 2: Choosing Platform Without Understanding Constraints**
**Problem**: Using Zapier for HIPAA-required feature, then having to rebuild everything

**Solution**: Complete constraint analysis FIRST, then select platform

### **❌ Mistake 3: No Clear Exit Criteria**
**Problem**: POC drags on indefinitely because "it's almost done"

**Solution**: Define success metrics upfront. Meet them or kill the project.

### **❌ Mistake 4: Ignoring Compliance from Day One**
**Problem**: Building entire POC with real PHI, then finding out it violates HIPAA

**Solution**: Use synthetic data for POC. Only use real data in production-compliant environment.

### **❌ Mistake 5: Not Documenting Platform Limitations**
**Problem**: Committing to low-code platform without knowing it can't handle production scale

**Solution**: Research platform limits before committing. Document what won't work.

## Summary: Quick Reference

1. **Analyze Constraints** → Compliance, Data, Scale, Integration, Time
2. **Select Platform** → Use decision tree based on constraints
3. **Split Features** → POC (core validation) vs Production (full implementation)
4. **Create Two Docs** → POC Requirements + Production Requirements
5. **Build POC** → Focus on validation, use synthetic data
6. **Decide** → Go to Production or Pivot based on POC results
7. **Build Production** → Add security, compliance, monitoring, scale

**Remember**: POC proves feasibility. Production provides reliability.
